3. Download these mods (I recommend using the CurseForge installer ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1448727/172022492-83054098-09b1-4466-b89c-721208e68341.png)):

5. Go to `Multiplayer`
6. Connect to `minecraft.colwyn.me`. You should see a green check mark. If you don't, you don't have the right mods installed

## Shaders
Shaders aren't required, but they make the game look pretty! To use custom shaders, you need to install a mod called OptiFine first that optimizes some aspects of Minecraft's graphics. Neither OptiFine nor the shaders themselves can be installed through Curseforge, for...reasons.
### Installing Optifine
1. Visit [The OptiFine downloads page](https://optifine.net/downloads) and download the version that matches your Minecraft version.
2. Open up CurseForge and choose "open folder" on the profile you created as part of the installation process above.![open-folder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4924494/172025789-08eeb5e4-d668-432c-8fa0-0bc4ec3e4f16.png)
3. Move the `.jar` file you downloaded in step 1 above into the `mods` folder inside your Minecraft profile.
### Installing Shaders
1. You can use any shaderpack you like; most can downloaded from CurseForge in the ["customization" category](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization) by searching "shaders". I used the option with the most downloads, "BSL Shaders", but the process should be the same for any shaderpack. Note that it's easier to find these on the CurseForge website than it is in the CurseForge app, because...reasons.
2. Click the download button on the shaderpack that you chose. This will not install it in CurseForge, but it will download a `.zip` file for you.
3. Repeat step 2 from "Installing OptiFine" above, opening up your profile folder.
4. Create a new folder here called `shaderpacks`. The name *must match exactly*.
5. Move the `.zip` file you downloaded in step 2 into this folder. *Do not unzip it!*
### Enabling shaders
1. Boot the game as you would normally using CurseForge.
2. In the "Options" menu, under "Video Settings", you should now have a new option titled "Shaders".
3. You'll see a menu where you can select which shaderpack you want. Click the title of the `.zip` file from step 5 above, and click "Done". The game might lag horribly for a second.

4. Enjoy your shaders!
